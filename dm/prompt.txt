Given the output of the NLU component of a dialogue system, tell me which action, as a Dialogue Manager, you should take. 
The set of possible actions are:
- request_info(slot_name), if a slot value is null
- confirmation(intent_name), if all slots are filled

Respond with the action and replace the argument of the action with the actual intent or slot name from the NLU json.

Example: request_info("pasta_type") or confirmation("food_ordering")
