 Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the user query "I would like to order a cheese pizza", the intent of the user can be classified as "pizza_ordering". Here's the JSON response:

{
"intent": "pizza_ordering",
"slots": {
"pizza_type": "cheese",
"pizza_count": null,
"pizza_size": null
}
}

Explanation:

* "intent": "pizza_ordering" is the classified intent of the user query.
* "slots": is a dictionary that contains the extracted slot values from the user query.
* "pizza_type": The slot value for "pizza_type" is "cheese".
* "pizza_count": The slot value for "pizza_count" is null, as the user did not provide any value for this slot.
* "pizza_size": The slot value for "pizza_size" is null, as the user did not provide any value for this slot.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.
