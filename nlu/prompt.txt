Given a user_query, you have to classify the intent of the user, selecting from one of the following:
- pizza_ordering

Once the intent has been classified extract the slot values from the user_query for the slots:
- pizza_type
- pizza_count
- pizza_size

If the value is not present just leave it as null.

Respond JUST in correct JSON format with an object having as keys: intent and the slots identified, slots that is a dict with slot names as keys and slot values extracted as values.
